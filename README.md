# Google Analytics Project
I pull a lot of reports from Google Analytics. This is repository is going to hold my customer functions and report set up. I currently not sure what they end goal is, but I am open to ideas.

Currently I am saving some of the funcitons I built for anyone who wants to use them. The will be stored in the [Custom Functions Folder](https://github.com/LLathrop1/GoogleAnalyticsProject/tree/main/Custom%20Functions)

The R package I am using is the [googleanalyticsR](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/googleAnalyticsR) by [Mark Edmondson](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234).  

[Mark Edmondson](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234) also has a great [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MarkEdmondsonAtHome/featured) where he does a few projects. *Some of the videos are older, but they are still great for a refrence.*
